CommonsPlayList
===============

This application makes use of the Twitter Commons library, its used to create a Playlist webservice.

<h3>What is Twitter Commons ?</h3>
Twitter Commons is a little known (seemingly) open source framework used to make creating web application easy. Its made up of a few components:

*Guice - For easy dependency injection.<br>
*Jersey - For writing REST applications with objects and annotations<br>
*Jetty - The Servlet Container<br>
*Jackson - Quick serialization and deserialization of Java objects

The Commons library supports Python or Java.. I chose Java.. just because..
The library also allows for easy statistics logging (which I am yet to include in this project).

<h3>What does this app do ?</h3>
It's a simple application that mimics a MP3 Player. So the user can add a Song (just trackName and length for now). The song will be added to the MP3 Library.
From here you can add the Song to a Playlist and view all the Songs in that Playlist or in the entire library.
Its a simple web app I created for learning purposes.

How do I perform the aforementioned operations ?
//TODO :)
